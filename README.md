# SolarTracker

Hardware and software for a servo controlled solar panel which orients itself to face directly towards the sun.

Plan to to have two modes of operation:

-Sensor: uses photodiode sensors to try and find the brightest source of light

-Auto: servo rotates as directed by a look up table based on the trajectory of the sun
