# SolarTracker

##Hardware and software for a servo controlled solar panel which orients itself to face directly towards the sun.

##Plan is to to have two modes:

-##Sensor: uses photodiode sensors to try and find the brightest source of light

-##Auto: servo rotates as directed by a look up table based on the trajectory of the sun
